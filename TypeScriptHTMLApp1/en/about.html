        <h2>Welcome to Dota Drafts!</h2>
        <br/>

        <b>What is Dota Drafts?</b>
        <p>Dota Drafts is the BEST Drafting AI to improve your drafting. It provides Hero recommendations based on your Opponent and Teammates' picks.</p>
        <br />

        <b>How does it work?</b>
        <p>It's simple. You start by selecting a hero from the available Hero Pool, and it would suggest the next best picks for both teams based on the situation.</p>
        <p>You can remove a Selected Hero by clicking on the Selection.</p>
        <p>You can change the Skill Bracket Selection any time and the recommendations will change correspondingly.</p>
        <br />
        
        <b>How relevant are the recommendations? Does it understand the META?</b>
        <p>Dota Drafts analyzes game results in the current patch. For Pro/Tournament skill bracket, it looks at the current month! So depending on your skill level, you can always keep up with the Meta.</p>
        <br />

        <b>Which skill bracket am I in?</b>
        <p>There isn't an exact cut-off for skill brackets. In general, you can determine your skill bracket by MMR.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Normal: Less than 3100</li>
            <li>High: Less than 3700</li>
            <li>Very High: Greater than 3700</li>
            <li>Pro: Greater than 4500</li>
        </ul>
        <br />

        <b>What makes Dota Draft the "best" drafting tool?</b>
        <p>The POWER of DATA!</p>
        <p>Unlike other recommendation systems, Dota Draft doesn't recommend Heroes based on the author's knowledge. It doesn’t do any manual calculations on the squishiness of the team, push power, disables, etc. Thus factoring out the inaccurate 'human part' of the recommendation.</p>
        <p>Instead, Dota Drafts focuses on the relative advantages between heroes. It analyzes every Dota match played in every Skill Bracket! Then it calculates the anti-advantage against each hero in the opponent team, and adds up the corporative advantage with each of your existing teammates. Therefore, without 'having any knowledge' about the game itself, Dota Drafts returns the best actionable picks based on the situation.</p>
